    <p class="smallbody" style="text-align:justify">Ever since I was a kid, I held onto the seemingly trivial and disposable. Over time, I accumulated receipts,
      maps, coasters, and cards in an ever growing and unweildy pile. I started pasting these mementos onto a wall
      as decor to preserve what would otherwise find itself buried beneath more recent collections, but when the tack dried out it left marks on both the paper and the paint. 
      More often than not, the tack dislodged from the wall leaving things scattered on the floor. I tried using painters tape instead, but this too fell short.

      While making the Lohding site, I realized that I had an opportunity to preserve my collection of mementos in a more permanent form.
      A digital wall has its own shortcomings: what was once a natural process of pasting items to a wall has become something distinctly clinical;
      The scans lack sense of scale and tactile qualities, and, as a public page, more personal notes and cards have to be excluded.
      Still, this page does what a physical wall cannot. It preserves the actual objects in their purest condition, while still displaying them in a way that prevents them from being forgotten.
